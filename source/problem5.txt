I uploaded the file Tista0.py on the GitHub website; Tista had sent to me
this file last weekend.

Please read up on the fun word game called Mad Libs
here:Â https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs

Now take a look at the example of Mad Libs in the Tista0.py file and make your
own version. One of you will be presenting your solution in class on Thursday.
