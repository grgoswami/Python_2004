# Use the following favorites dictionary below and answer the questions below

favorites = {
'Ari': ['Dosa', 'Gol gappe', 'Paan', 'Roti'],
'Anya': ['Salad', 'Cheese'],
'Gia': ['Cheese', 'Cookies', 'Goat masala'],
'Yuvi': ['Samosa', 'Poori roti', 'Poori'], 
'Shraddha': ['Pau Bhaji', 'Pani puri', 'Naan'], 
'Tista': ['Ice cream', 'Cookies'],
'Auyona': ['Phoochka', 'Sandesh'], 
'Evaan': ['Samosa', 'Briyani', 'Cookies']
}

#1. What's Tista's second favorite food, print it?
# Write your code below


#2. How many favorite foods does Shraddha have, print it?
# Hint: use the len() function that I used in class
# Write your code below


#3. Use a for loop to iterate over the dictionary and count the number of
# favorite foods that each of you have and print like this:
#
# Ari has 4 favorite foods
# Anya has 2 favorite foods
# ...
# Write your code below


#4. Special credit (HARD): Iterate over the dictionary favorites and print the
# name of the person if she/he has 'Chesse' as their favorite food. 
# Hint: You need to use a for loop for dictionary and then a for loop for 
# lists inside the first for loop and then an if statement to check
# for equality using ==, as we saw in class yesterday.
# Write your code below
