The following Capstone project ideas are inspired by:

    

https://papersowl.com/blog/best-capstone-project-topic-ideas

    

1. How to motivate students



2. The importance of adjusting how to assess student learning



3. The role of virtual classroom management in improving student behavior



Your goal for this problem set is to take one of the topics above and 

think about three concrete steps to solve any of the above problems.



Our final goal is to take some of your unique ideas, refine them and

build a real project using Python (and or other tools). May be some day

you'll start your own company when one of your ideas grow big!



You've already showed us the basics and how to use them in things like classifying age and how people

use them in g-mail and stuff. But I think that there are other ways to use them like in games. In other

words I did some research and I think that there's a way that you can play games on python using only

the things you taught and showed us. I think that there is a way to improve your problem sets in a way that 

will encourage students to do them. I left an example of what I mean about the problem sets below. I think making

these type of problem sets gives students more to play with. If you dont understand something please e-mail me.



Example : Mad Libs Using Python (Because this is an example I'm only going to do a little )



name = input('Enter your name')
age = int(input('Enter your age'))

thing1 = input ('Enter something you like to do')

thing2 = input ('Enter something else you like to do')

place = input ('Enter a place that you either want to go to or a place that you like going to')

thing_to_do = input ('Enter something you want to do or like doing in that place')

friend =  input ('Enter the name of one of your friends')

food = input ('Enter your favorite food')

food1 = input ('Enter another one of your favorite foods')





print ('hi ' + name)
print (name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old')
print (name + ' likes to ' + thing1 + ' and ' + thing2 )

print ('One day ' + name +' ' + friend + ' went to ' + place)

print ('In ' + place + name + 'and' + friend + ' decided to ' + thing_to_do)

print ('For lunch they had ' + food + 'and' + food1 )
