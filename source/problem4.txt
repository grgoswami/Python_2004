1. How to motivate students

2. The importance of adjusting how to assess student learning

3. The role of virtual classroom management in improving student behavior

Your goal for this problem set is to take one of the topics above and 
think about three concrete steps to solve any of the above problems.

Our final goal is to take some of your unique ideas, refine them and
build a real project using Python (and or other tools). May be some day
you'll start your own company when one of your ideas grow big!
